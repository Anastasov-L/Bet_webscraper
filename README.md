# Bet_webscraper
Web scraper, that gives information on the two safest bets. It considers Live Football Matches and begins the process of betting. If there aren't at least 2 live football matches, the script utilises other 2 live matches from the other options (basketball, volleyball etc). Script utilises puppeteer.
**(Please don't use it to actually bet on the website, it's just a project and it is not to be taken seriously). I DISCOURAGE GAMBLING OF ALL SORTS!**

**HOW TO RUN:** 
1. "npm install" to get all dependencies
2. "npm start" to start the script
3.  be patient, the script utilises a lot of pauses, so that the page loads fully, regardless of internet speed.

**DISCLAIIMER: I DISCOURAGE GAMBLING OF ALL SORTS!**
The structure of the website will change at some point in the future, which will make this script obsolete.
